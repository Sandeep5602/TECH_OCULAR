# Smart-Glass
Vision plays a major role in our day today life.Vision is a essential factor which helps us to survive. Our main idea is  to develop a smart glass for visually challeged people toread books without any guide to dictate.
Our project helps visualy impaired people as a artificial eye and scans the books using camera fixed on smart glass which is connect to a H-computing device jetson-nano  it extracts the text from the taken image and give it as audio output to the visually challenged people.
Visually impaired people can gain more knowledge independently by using our project idea. So, we design a spectacle which is different from ordinary one, it consists of a camera, earphones, microphone and ultrasonic sensor.
We get a voice command to access camera and scan the book or any other document which the user wants to read. We extract the text from the image using OCR (Tesseract model) and using gTTs the extracted text is converted into voice output and we pass the output using headphones to the user. 
We run this model in raspberry pi. This can be implemented for multiple language based on the users need.
